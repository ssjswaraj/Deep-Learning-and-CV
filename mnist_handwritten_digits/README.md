In this project, we utilize the MNIST digit dataset to develop and train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for digit classification. 

The MNIST dataset, a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning, comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, ranging from 0 to 9. Each image is 28x28 pixels, providing a rich source of data for training our model.
