## Perceptron Scratch

This project entails the development of a Perceptron algorithm from scratch for binary classification tasks. Leveraging the make_classification function from the sklearn.datasets module, we generated a synthetic dataset containing two features. Following the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, we visualized the dataset and plotted the decision boundary obtained from the Perceptron on a graph.

Technologies Used:
* Python
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn (for dataset generation)
